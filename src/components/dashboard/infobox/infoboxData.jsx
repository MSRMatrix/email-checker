      text: `Explanation: A "disposable" email address is a temporary, often
          automatically generated email address that is used for a short period
          or until a few emails are received. It is commonly used to avoid spam
          or register on websites without exposing your personal email address.
          These addresses are typically deleted after a short time and are no
          longer accessible.`,

      text: `   Explanation: DNS is a system that translates domain names (like
          www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to communicate
          over the internet. It works like a phonebook: when you type a website
          address, DNS retrieves the corresponding IP address, allowing your
          browser to locate and display the website. In simple terms, DNS helps
          convert human-readable addresses into machine-readable ones.`,

      name: "Domain",
      text: `Explanation: A domain is the name of a website or network resource on
          the internet that allows access without needing to input the IP
          address directly. For example, in the URL www.example.com, the
          "example.com" part is the domain. Domains are typically divided into
          different levels, with the Top-Level Domain (TLD), such as .com, .org,
          or .net, being the highest level.`,

      name: "Email",
      text: `Explanation: An email is a method of sending and receiving digital
          messages over the internet. An email address typically consists of a
          username (e.g., username) followed by the "@" symbol and a domain name
          (e.g., example.com). Email is one of the most common forms of
          communication for both personal and professional use.`,

      name: "Format",
      text: `  Explanation: "Format" refers to the structure or organization of
          something, often used to describe the way data or content is arranged.
          In the context of emails or files, it refers to how the information is
          structured (e.g., text, HTML, or PDF formats). For example, an email
          format can be plain text or rich text (HTML).`,

      name: "Whitelist",
      text: ` Explanation: A "whitelist" is a list of approved or trusted entities,
          such as email addresses or IP addresses. If an email address or domain
          is on a whitelist, emails sent from that address are considered safe
          and will not be marked as spam. Whitelisting is used as a way to allow
          only trusted sources to bypass filters or restrictions.`,
